    "# XGBoost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is an ensemble learning method which is based on a collection of ensemble tree models. Aggregate the predictions from either a group of classifiers, or regressors. In this example I have chosen to classify the results from the 'Telco Customer Churn' dataset providing a Boolean result of True or False with respect to Churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on a group of Decision Tree Classifiers first, with each classifier being trained on a random subset of the overall training data set. Then the predictions from all individual trees are then aggregated to predict the overall class that gets the most votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the sequence of events, XGBoost is normally applied at the last stage of a prediction or classification model. The other prediction/classification models are all aggregated to predict the prediction/class with the most votes - known as a 'hard voting predictor/classifier'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all achieved using a series of 'boosting', 'bagging' and 'stacking' applications but first, I need to import the necessary libraries."

    "\n",
    "What is apparent about the data at first glance? How can I shape the data? Can I perform dimensionality reduction? Can I perform feature engineering to improve the data quality? What relationships and insights can I gain from the information and does it require cleaning, re-scaling or pre-processing of any sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which are the columns to be used in the feature subset and target column? At this stage I know that the 'Churn' column will be my target vector, but the predictor feature subset may require some work so it's best to try and understand each and every one of these columns in their entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summarize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I extracted this dataset from the Kaggle web site. In the Dataset option in the Navigation menu on the left hand side, I am provided with a Search option. Requesting 'Telco-Customer-Churn' using search provides me with a list of options ranked according to 'Hotness' which is some measure of popularity. So the data sources on this page are all in flat file format such as XLSX or CSV which makes it easier to read the tabular structured data into Pandas, or a SQL DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have decided to check a couple of variations of this IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset; the file provided by 'BlastChar' entitled 'Telco Customer Churn' and that of 'Jack Chang' entitled 'Telco customer churn (11.1.3+)'. Taking a look at any differences I have to decide which file would be more suitable for the purpose of this classification algorithm and where I can find the most comprehensive information summarizing the dataset? The reason I like using Kaggle is because they categorize their datasets according to popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how churn works is key to this project. It is a measure of whether or not customers are leaving, (the rate of loss, the attrition rate) or their dropout rate compared to the entire set of customers. This particular dataset is based on a fictional telecom company but discovering the rate of churn in general can be extremely useful if it's compared to that of other companies within the same industry. It can be used as a tool to monitor fluctuating consumer tastes and the effectiveness of competing companies. Ultimately the churn rate can be used to try and retain customers by predicting their behaviour.\n",
