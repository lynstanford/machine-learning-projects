    "# Data Engineering Process\n",
    "## 1. Bring new data into the company\n",
    " - Structured, semi-structured or unstructured?\n",
    " - Private (on premise), public or hybrid cloud architecture?\n",
    " - AWS, Azure, Databricks, Hadoop or GCP service?\n",
    " - Flat file, database, tabular format?\n",
    " - Web API, repositories, cloud services?\n",
    " - Codecs, single or multiple files, or objects?\n",
    " - Is software, libraries, packages, modules or dependencies up to date?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Write a Data Feed or Data Pipeline Script\n",
    " - Streamline the process using ETL principle\n",
    " - Manual or automated?\n",
    " - Removing null values and duplicates\n",
    " - Regular Filesystem or Object Storage using on or off-site distributed filesystem such as Hadoop?\n",
    " - Script to add computation to existing tables or create partitions to existing tables\n",
    " - Language specification e.g. Python, PySpark, JSON, C++, Java, YAML, Scala\n",
    " - EC2 (Elastic Cloud Connect), EMR (Elastic Map Reduce), AWS S3 (Simple Storage System), HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), Cloudera, Hive, Pig, SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Making Tables easier to query with Views\n",
    " - Abstracting the data away for the data analyst, scientist or end-user\n",
    " - Reshaping the data and pre-processing it\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Monitoring Data Jobs or Automated Processes\n",
    " - Scheduling tasks is an important part of this process\n",
    " - Cluster management consoles, GUI's or Task Schedulers such as Airflow will help\n",
    " - As more and more data is added it needs to be monitored\n",
    " - Batch processing or Streaming data feeds\n",
    " - A data vendor might change the number of columns in their table which might cause your validation to fail\n",
    " - They might change the names of the columns and your script might have been checking for the original names\n",
    " - Any changes by the vendor will affect your validation step\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Helping Others\n",
    " - Helping others means setting time aside\n",
    " - May need to grant permissions, download drivers, explain console connections or pipeline process\n",
    " - Skillsets constantly changing as tech becomes obsolete quickly and industry training is imperative to keep up"
