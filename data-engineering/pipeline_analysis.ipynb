    "# Exploring Data with Python\n",
    "A significant part of a a data scientist's role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. There are many tools and programming languages that they can use to do this. One of the most popular approaches is to use Jupyter notebooks (like this one) and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language that is used in a wide range of scenarios—from web applications to device programming. It's extremely popular in the data science and machine learning community because of the many packages it supports for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore some of these packages and apply basic techniques to analyze data. This is not intended to be a comprehensive Python programming exercise or even a deep dive into data analysis. Rather, it's intended as a crash course in some of the common ways in which data scientists can use Python to work with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you've never used the Jupyter Notebooks environment before, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n",
    "Notebooks are made up of cells. Some cells (like this one) contain markdown text, while others (like the one beneath this one) contain code.\n",
    "You can run each code cell by using the ► Run button. The ► Run button will show up when you hover over the cell.\n",
    "The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells in order. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
    "Exploring data arrays with NumPy\n",
    "Let's start by looking at some simple data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a college professor takes a sample of student grades from a class to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the cell below by clicking the ► Run button to see the data."
