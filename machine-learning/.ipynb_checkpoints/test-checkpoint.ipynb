The purpose of using a ridge regression model is to try to reduce or eliminate the coefficient values of all the various features (especially those with high multi-colinearity between predictors) and will increase bias slightly but should decrease variance significantly. Ridge regression achieves this by assigning equal weights to those coefficient values which have high colinearity."
