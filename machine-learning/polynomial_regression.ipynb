    "So according to the visualizations from the <a href=\"https://github.com/lynstanford/machine-learning-projects/machine-learning/multiple_regression.ipynb\">Linear Regression</a> notebook, the connection between the dependent and independent variables appear to be strongly linear in relationship although the connection between the 'Volume' of daily bitcoin bought and sold has less association with the daily 'Close' price. \n",

However, out of curiosity I decided to see if a Polynomial function could fit the line slightly better by employing a regularization technique to try and improve the bias term by decreasing the Mean Squared Error.\n",

    "So I can determine the use of ridge regression to regularize the model has produced a slight increase in overall variance but also a slight increase in bias of output prediction. Ridge regression should reduce the variance and if not, I probably need to adjust the 'degrees of freedom' hyperparameter for the cost function for the Polynomial model which feeds into it, or tune the 'alpha' hyperparameter in the actual ridge regression model itself. Tuning these inputs ...........\n",
