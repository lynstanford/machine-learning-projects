    "# Polynomial Regression\n",
    "The first question I needed to ask myself is why decide to use Polynomial Regression and what does it do exactly? So according to the visualizations from the <a href=\"https://github.com/lynstanford/machine-learning-projects/machine-learning/multiple_regression.ipynb\">Linear Regression</a> notebook, the connection between the dependent and independent variables appear to be strongly linear in relationship although the connection between the 'Volume' of daily bitcoin bought and sold has less association with the daily 'Close' price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting a Linear Regression line to the data may be accurate in this case, with an R-squared value of 0.9991392014437468 and RMSE of 689.1925598643533. However, out of curiosity I decided to see if a Polynomial function could fit the line slightly better by employing a regularization technique to try and improve the bias term by decreasing the Mean Squared Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The r-squared value is used to represent the overall accuracy score and directly measures the degree of variability associated between the predictors and target variable. The root mean squared value is represented as a loss function and my aim is to reduce its overall value as much as possible using regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that Polynomial Regression is useful in determining non-linear relationships between multiple independent variables and the dependent variable, so it can be classified as a type of multiple linear regression. I can try to improve the fit of a prediction line to the data and improve estimates by changing the 'degree of fit' parameter, or by utilizing regularization.\n",
